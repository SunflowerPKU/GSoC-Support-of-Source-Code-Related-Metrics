Microtask 8:
====================
Create a Python script to execute flake8 for a given commit of any Git repository. Given a commit SHA and a Git repository, the script should clone the repository (if it doesn't exist locally), perform a checkout based on the commit SHA and execute flake8 on that checkout. The script should return a message that either lists the errors found or "OK" if flake8 successfully ended.
