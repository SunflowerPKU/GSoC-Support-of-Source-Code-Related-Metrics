# Idea 3 of Chaoss from GSOC 2019
I have already completed all the micro-tasks for "[GSoC Idea: Support of Source Code Related Metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab/issues/182)".

*Because I registered a new GitHub account [LuckLittleBird](https://github.com/LuckyLittleBird) some time ago, which casued my local computer to be bound to this new account [LuckLittleBird](https://github.com/LuckyLittleBird), there were two contributors. In fact, all the contributions come from me alone.*
